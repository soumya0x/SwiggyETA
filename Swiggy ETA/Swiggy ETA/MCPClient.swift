/// Protocol quirks (learned the hard way — see the `gotcha-swiggy-mcp-protocol` memory):
///   • Food and Instamart live on DIFFERENT endpoints:
///       Food      → https://mcp.swiggy.com/food
///       Instamart → https://mcp.swiggy.com/im   (not /instamart!)
///   • `Accept` header MUST include BOTH `application/json` and `text/event-stream`
///   • Response may be raw JSON or SSE-framed — we handle both
///   • Real data lives in `result.structuredContent`, EXCEPT for `track_food_order`
///     which returns empty structuredContent — use `get_food_orders` instead.
///   • `get_food_orders` requires `addressId`. Any addressId works with
///     `activeOnly: true` — we fetch one via `get_addresses` and cache it.
///   • For each active Food order we ALSO call `get_food_delivery_status` to
///     get a live ETA, terminal flags (delivered/cancelled), and Swiggy's
///     suggested `pollIntervalSec`. Food ETA lives in a separate tool, not
///     in `get_food_orders`.

// MARK: - MCP capture log (forensic JSONL for post-order analysis)
//
// Writes one JSON object per line to
// `~/Library/Application Support/Myles/captures/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`.
// Each entry has: timestamp, tool name, endpoint URL, arguments, and the
// full raw response envelope (including anything in `content[]` that our
// typed decoders drop). Fire-and-forget — write errors are swallowed so
// capture never blocks or breaks a real poll.
//
// Purpose: when Swiggy's MCP surface changes (or we suspect we're dropping a
// field), turn this on, place an order, then read the JSONL to see exactly
// what came over the wire — not just what our typed models decode. This is
// how we found the conversational status text hiding in `content[]`.
//
// ENABLEMENT
//   • DEBUG builds  → ON by default (dev loop convenience).
//   • RELEASE builds → OFF by default. Responses contain order history,
//     addresses, and item names, so the installed app shouldn't accumulate
//     that on disk unless explicitly asked.
//   • Either default can be overridden without a rebuild:
//         defaults write com.soumya.SwiggyETA MylesCaptureMCPResponses -bool true
//         defaults write com.soumya.SwiggyETA MylesCaptureMCPResponses -bool false
//     Read once at startup, so flip it then relaunch.
//
// RETENTION
//   One file per day (day computed at write time, so an app left running
//   across midnight rolls over correctly). Files older than `retentionDays`
//   are pruned once per launch, so an always-on capture can't grow forever.
